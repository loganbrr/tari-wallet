### Architecture
Service-oriented async architecture with layered design:
- **Applications** → **Base Layer** → **Communication** → **Infrastructure**
- Communication via async channels within apps, encrypted P2P between nodes
- Storage: LMDB for blockchain, SQLite for application data
- Security: Noise protocol encryption, domain-separated hashing

### Key Files
- Entry points: `applications/*/src/main.rs` (each app's main function)
- Config: `common/config/` (network-specific configurations)
- Core blockchain: `base_layer/core/src/` (consensus, validation, chain storage)
- Wallet core: `base_layer/wallet/src/` (UTXO management, transaction service)
- P2P stack: `comms/core/src/` (transport, multiplexing, connectivity)
- APIs: `applications/minotari_app_grpc/proto/` (gRPC definitions)

### Conventions
- Service pattern: Each component runs as async service with request/response channels
- Builder pattern: Complex objects use `.with_*()` builders
- Domain separation: All crypto operations use `DomainSeparatedHasher`
- Error handling: `thiserror` for structured errors with context
- Testing: Unit tests in modules, integration in `tests/`, BDD in `integration_tests/`
- Linting: `cargo +nightly-2025-01-01 lints clippy` for comprehensive checks

### Critical Patterns
- **Safe conversions**: Use `try_from()` for integer casts to prevent overflow
- **SQL optimization**: Direct database queries vs loading all data into memory
- **Async everywhere**: Built on Tokio, all I/O operations are async
- **Secure by default**: All network comms encrypted, keys properly managed

### Important Notes
- **Connectivity optimizations**: DHT handles all peer discovery (no redundant mechanisms)
- **Database performance**: Use SQL WHERE clauses for peer selection, not in-memory filtering  
- **Mining integration**: Merge mining proxy coordinates between XMRig, Monero, and Tari
- **Recovery**: Wallet recovery scans blockchain from birthday block using key derivation
- **Network layers**: Localnet (dev), Nextnet (testnet), Mainnet (production)

### Build Commands
- Development: `cargo build --release --all-features`
- Linting: `cargo +nightly-2025-01-01 lints clippy --all-targets --all-features`
- Testing: `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
- Formatting: `cargo +nightly fmt --all`
